This past week saw the most surprising finance news of the year unfold. Sam Altman, the founder and CEO of the most illustrious AI company, OpenAI, was fired by the board on the grounds of being deceiving.

The entire finance community was in shock at how the board could fire a man from his own company, and many likened the events that occured to Steve Jobs in 1985 with Apple.

However, Sam Altman and a few important coworkers weren't gone for long, and continue to hold the reins to OpenAI - in which we all should be grateful.

*Here are the events in the order they occured*
1. *November 16th* : Sam Altman steps down after the board of directors ousted him for "not being candid" üòÇ
2. *November 17th* : The executive shakeup of Sam Altman and co is announced to the public
3. *November 18th* : Board of Directors feels the pressure
- Investors are furious, and tell the board to reinstate Sam as CEO
- Valuation of company at $86 billion for employee shares starts to appear inflated
- COO of OpenAI reports that the decision was not made because of wrongdoing, rather a disagreement ‚ùì
4. *November 19th* : Unrelenting Board appoints former Twitch CEO as interim Open-AI CEO
5. *November 20th* : Altman considers joining Microsoft, and 650 of the 770 employees at OpenAI threaten to quit unless Altman is reinstated
  *Seems like the founder has some people on his side, call that leverage*
6. *November 21st* : Altman and Co rejoin OpenAI once again, with a new board on deck. Effective communication amongst the board and management is a primary concern going forward.

  **Wow. What a turn of events.**
  
  The decision the board made to remove Altman really backfired, and it seems like the company might have benefitted from this debacle overall. To start, they have a new board with fresh ideas regarding AI.
  Ideas that are much less pessimistic and irrational about the potential for AGI to destroy the world, like something out of a Terminator movie. AGI certainly does have the potential to create such a catastrophe, but the revolutionary benefits of the technology seems to overcome such a disastrous, unlikely scenario.
  Most importantly, they didn't lose a single employee. The crew that created revolutionary products such as **ChatGPT**, **GPT-4**, and **Dall-E** remains.

  **Now, we can sit back and watch the evolution of AI, knowing that it is in the right hands.**
